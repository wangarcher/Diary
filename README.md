别用那个逆运动学1 
Do not use the inverse kinematics, that program was so fucking stupid and I just don't wanna update it anymore.

今天写了两个不是很傻的东西，就是迭代法的逆运动学。
Today, I've wrote several staffs which aren't that stupid like before, the recursive algorithm of inverse kinematics.

2R那个是一个典型的2R迭代算法，可以得到一个解。
that 2R blahblah is a typical recursive algorithm, you can get only one solution of the problem. I mean there are supposed to have two. 

后面那个是一个3R平面的，我仔细想了一下这个理论的泛用性，认为他是可以接受这种冗余的，所以也做了。可以得到很多的解，一大堆的解。
the thing next to it is a planar robot arm with 3R, I've thought about the universality of this algorithm carefully, so I wrote it, too. You can have lot of solutions of it. I really mean it, every time you run it, you would have different solutions.

对不起我说错了。那个只能得到一个特解。

感觉精度还是可以，总比那个逆运动学1要精确的多。。。
I felt like that its accuracy is much better than the shit I've done before.

为什么自己想当然的算法就那么的沙雕。
Fuck, Why my alogrithm fucked up in every fucking try. Fuck.

FUCK!!!!!
